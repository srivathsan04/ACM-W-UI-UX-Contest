# Description of the Components and Functionalities of Our Design:
We have created a Design for an OTT platform.   

The main components of my design are:  


Homepage: The homepage is the central hub of the OTT platform. It should include a search bar, a list of featured content, and links to other sections of the platform.  

Categories: The categories section should allow users to browse content by genre. This can be done by using a drop-down menu or a grid of thumbnails.  

Search: The search bar should allow users to find content by title, actor, or keyword.  

Profile: The profile section should allow users to view their viewing history, create custom profiles, and manage their parental controls.  


The main functionalities of my design are:  


Content browsing: Users should be able to easily browse through the content on the platform. This can be done by using the categories section, the search bar, or the featured content section on the homepage.  

Content playback: Once a user has found a piece of content they want to watch, they should be able to start playing it immediately. The playback should be smooth and high quality.  

User profiles: Users should be able to create custom profiles. This will allow them to keep track of their viewing history and to create personalized recommendations.

User Interactions:  

Tapping on Categories will take you to the category page.  

Tapping on the profile icon will give you a drop down menu which has sign out option and settings option.  

Tapping on the sign out option will take you to the sign in page
